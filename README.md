# Football_match_analysis
This football analysis project employs YOLO for tracking players, referees, and footballs in video footage. Using K-means clustering, players are assigned to teams by T-shirt color. The project measures ball possession, analyzes player movement via optical flow, corrects perspective distortion, and calculates speed and distance covered.
