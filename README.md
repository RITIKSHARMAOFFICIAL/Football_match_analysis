## Introduction

Welcome to the Football Match Analysis project! This project aims to harness the power of artificial intelligence to detect and track players, referees, and footballs in a video using YOLO, one of the leading AI object detection models available. The core objectives of this project include:

1. **Player, Referee, and Football Detection**: Leveraging YOLO for accurate identification and tracking.
2. **Team Assignment**: Using Kmeans for pixel segmentation and clustering to assign players to their respective teams based on t-shirt colors.
3. **Ball Acquisition Analysis**: Measuring each team's ball acquisition percentage throughout the match.
4. **Player Movement Tracking**: Utilizing optical flow to measure camera movement between frames for precise player movement tracking.
5. **Perspective Transformation**: Implementing perspective transformation to convert pixel movement into real-world measurements (meters).
6. **Performance Metrics**: Calculating players' speed and the distance covered during the match.

This project is designed to address real-world problems and is suitable for both beginners and experienced machine learning engineers.

## Modules Used

This project leverages several powerful modules to achieve its goals:

1. **YOLO**: AI object detection model for identifying and tracking objects.
2. **Kmeans**: For pixel segmentation and clustering to detect t-shirt colors.
3. **Optical Flow**: To measure camera movement between frames.
4. **Perspective Transformation**: To represent the scene's depth and perspective.
5. **Performance Metrics**: To calculate speed and distance covered per player.
